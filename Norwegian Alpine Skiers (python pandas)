olympics_athletes_events

id:         int64
name:       object
sex:        object
age:        float64
height:     float64
weight:     datetime64[ns]
team:       object
noc:        object
games:      object
year:       int64
season:     object
city:       object
sport:      object

non_team:   datetime64[ns]

Solution:

# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
df = olympics_athletes_events
df = df.loc[df['noc'] == 'NOR'] # only Norway skiiers

#make two dataframes, one for each year, and then left out join them
df1 = df.loc[df['year'] == 1992]
df2 = df.loc[df['year'] == 1994]
df_final = pd.merge(df1, df2, on=['name','name'], how="outer", indicator=True)
df_final = df_final[df_final['_merge'] == 'left_only']

# Drop all duplicate entries, just in case
df_final = df_final.drop_duplicates(subset=['id_x'])

# and print out the list of names
df_final['name']

Output:

name
Ole Kristian Furuseth
Astrid Ldemel
Kjetil Andr Aamodt
Didrik Marksten

Discussion:

The difficulty for me here was finding the syntax required for a left outer join. 
I wanted to keep everything that was in the 1992 dataframe but NOT the 1994 dataframe.
adding the "Indicator=True" tag in the merge adds an extra column indicating how that entry was included in the merge. the line right below
only keeps the ones that were left outer joined.
