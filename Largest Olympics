olympics_athletes_events

id:         int
name:       varchar
sex:        varchar
age:        float
height:     float
weight:     datetime
team:       varchar
noc:        varchar
games:      varchar
year:       int
season:     varchar
city:       varchar
sport:      varchar
event:      varchar
medal:      varchar
non_team:   datetime

Solution:

-- only need "games" column
-- return gmaes, count(games), grouped by games

select games,count(distinct id) as num_athletes
from olympics_athletes_events
group by games
order by num_athletes desc
limit 1
;

Output: 

games	      num_athletes
1924 Summer	118

Discussion:

A solution to the "highest number" or "maximum in column" problem is to use a limit at the end of the query. You can run into problems when you have multiple
entries that have the same value, like if there had been multiple olympic games with 118 athletes. If thats the case, you might think of using a dense_rank()
function and taking all with highest rank.
