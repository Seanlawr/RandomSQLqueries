Product Transaction Count

Microsoft Medium
General Practice ID 10163

Description:

Find the number of transactions that occurred for each product. 
Output the product name along with the corresponding number of transactions and order records by the product id in ascending order. 
You can ignore products without transactions.

excel_sql_inventory_data

product_id:         int
product_name:       varchar
product_type:       varchar
unit:               varchar
price_unit:         float
wholesale:          float
current_inventory:  int

excel_sql_transaction_data

transaction_id: int
time:           datetime
product_id:     int

Solution:

-- right join tables on product_id
-- count all and group by name.
-- order by product_id

with CTE as (select inv.product_id, inv.product_name, count(*) as number_of_transactions 
from excel_sql_inventory_data inv
right join excel_sql_transaction_data tra
on inv.product_id = tra.product_id
group by 1,2
order by inv.product_id)
select product_name, number_of_transactions
from CTE;

Output:

product_name	              number_of_transactions
strawberry	                5
apple_fuji	                9
orange	                    6
clementines	                6
blood_lime	                5
tayberry	                  6
pluot	                      8
tangelo	                    9
pomello	                    6
pineberry	                  10
vegan_egg_substitute	      10
falafel_chips   	          7
sweet_potato_hockey_pucks	  9

Discussion:

Not too difficult of a query here. The interesting bit was that we could ignore products that didn't have a transaction, which meant we needed everything from the
right table, and only matching items from the left table. We get to demonstrate use of the rarely applied right join!
Additionally, after we do that and only keep relevant columns, we have to order by product_id. But that id isn't asked for in the final solution, so we need to
make another query to get rid of it. We make a CTE and only pull out product_name and number_of_transactions, finishing up the query.
