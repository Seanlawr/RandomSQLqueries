forbes_global_2010_2014

company:        varchar
sector:         varchar
industry:       varchar
continent:      varchar
country:        varchar
marketvalue:    float
sales:          float
profits:        float
assets:         float
rank:           int
forbeswebpage:  varchar

Solution:

-- Select only company, continent from table, then count companies over each continent. Use this as CTE
-- get maximum count out of our CTE
-- Use this as subquery to only return maximum companies. Use distinct to only return one.

with CTE as (select company, continent, count(company) over (partition by continent) as number_of_companies
from forbes_global_2010_2014
group by 2,1
order by continent)

select distinct continent, number_of_companies
from CTE
where number_of_companies = (select max(number_of_companies)
                                from CTE);

Output: 

continent	      number_of_companies
North America	  40

Discussion:

This problem involved a little bit of everything. We needed to make a CTE to filter out only the columns we needed to use. We used a window function to
partition the count by continent. Then we pulled out the maximum using a subquery so we could only keep entries that matched that maximum. This is a 
great example to show off everything SQL queries can make use of to simplify pulling data out of tables.
