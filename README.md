# RandomSQLqueries

This is a repository for random practice SQL queries I created while practicing on websites such as stratascratch.
This is meant to showcase SQL queries I think are interesting or involve using one or more complicated things.

Each query is broken up into a title and id of where I got the problem, a description of the problem as given and the table(s)
used, and then the solution and output. We finish off with a discussion of the interesting aspects of the query.
