Description:

Find the percentage of shipable orders.
Consider an order is shipable if the customer's address is known.

orders

id:               int
cust_id:          int
order_date:       datetime
order_details:    varchar
total_order_cost: int

customers

id:           int
first_name:   varchar
last_name:    varchar
city:         varchar
address:      varchar
phone_number: varchar

Solution:

-- Join tables on id, need id and shipping address
-- case when address is null 0 else 1 in a new column
-- sum up new column divided by count(*) * 100

with CTE as (select o.cust_id, c.address, 
    case when c.address is null then 0 else 1 end as add_avail
from orders o
join customers c on o.cust_id = c.id)

select sum(add_avail)/count(*)*100 as avail_perc
from CTE;

Output:

avail_perc
28

Discussion: 

This problem needed a clever addition of a new column, which was 1 if the address was known and 0 otherwise. We could then use it to calculate out percentage,
by having the numerator be the sum of the rows that had an address. With this idea, the query actually became quite trivial with a CTE.
