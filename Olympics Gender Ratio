name:       varchar
sex:        varchar
age:        float
height:     float

Solution:

-- need games, sex
-- pull out name of games and sex of participant
-- count the number of men and women (Case statement)
-- calculate ratio

with CTE as (select games, 
        sum(CASE 
            WHEN sex = 'M' THEN 1
            ELSE 0
            END) AS Males,
        sum(CASE 
            WHEN sex = 'F' THEN 1
            ELSE 0
            END) AS Females
from olympics_athletes_events
group by games)
select *, round(Case when Females = 0 then 'NULL' ELSE (Males/Females) end, 2) as Gender_Ratio
from CTE;

Output:
 
games	      Males	Females	Gender_Ratio
1924 Summer	115	   7	    16.43
1904 Summer	36	   3	    12
1908 Summer	72	   2	    36
1900 Summer	40	   2	    20
1992 Winter	4	     3	    1.33
1988 Winter	0	     2	    0
1994 Winter	2	     5	    0.4
2012 Summer	1	     1	    1
1936 Summer	0	     4	    0
2016 Summer	28	   22	    1.27
2008 Summer	1	     1	    1
1996 Summer	1	     0	    0
1984 Summer	1	     0	    0
2004 Summer	0	     1	    0

Discussion:

Needed to make a CTE that counted the number of males and females in each games. SQL queries tend to be easier to write when everyhting is located
in the same table all together. The next issue was that if there were no women at the games, then the diviion in the outer query would divide by 0.
so we need to include another case statement that just makes that case null.
