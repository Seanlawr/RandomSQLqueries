Problem Description:

Find quarterbacks with the most interceptions in 2016. Output the quarterbacks along with the corresponding number of interceptions. 
Sort records by the interceptions in descending order.

qbstats_2015_2016

qb:           varchar
att:          int
cmp:          int
yds:          int
ypa:          float
td:           int
int:          int
lg:           varchar
sack:         int
loss:         int
rate:         float
game_points:  int
home_away:    varchar
year:         int

Discussion: The problme here is that one of the columns we need to use to answer this problem, the "int" column, is named the same as one of the reserved words
in MySQL, "int". So when we try to select that column, MySQL throws an error. We can get around this in the query by putting backticks around the word "int, as
in the solution. The better way to get around this is to not name your columns these sorts of things.

Solution:

select qb, sum(`int`) as total_ints
from qbstats_2015_2016
where year = 2016
group by qb
order by total_ints desc;

Output:

qb	                                  total_ints
Philip RiversP. Rivers	              21

Discussion P.S.:

Don't have your name column data like this either, it's a pain in the butt to parse through.
