Total Sales In Different Currencies


Interview Question Date: May 2021

Salesforce  Medium  Active Interview  ID 2041

Description:

You work for a multinational company that wants to calculate total sales across all their countries they do business in.
You have 2 tables, one is a record of sales for all countries and currencies the company deals with, and the other holds currency exchange rate information.
Calculate the total sales, per quarter, for the first 2 quarters in 2020, and report the sales in USD currency.

sf_exchange_rate

source_currency:  varchar
target_currency:  varchar
exchange_rate:    float
date:             datetime

sf_sales_amount

sales_date:        datetime
sales_amount:      int
currency:          varchar

My Solution:

-- Join both tables on the date and source currency, filter only first two quarters
-- calculate each sale in USD
-- add a "quarter" column with what quarter the date is in.
-- Group by quarter

with CTE as (select exch.source_currency, exch.target_currency, exch.exchange_rate, exch.date, sale.sales_amount, round(sale.sales_amount*exch.exchange_rate, 2) as USD_sales, 
    CASE
    WHEN exch.date < '2020-04-01' THEN '1'
    ELSE '2'
  END AS quarter
from sf_exchange_rate exch
join sf_sales_amount sale
on exch.date = sale.sales_date and exch.source_currency = sale.currency
where exch.date < '2020-07-01')

select quarter, sum(USD_sales) as sales
from CTE
group by quarter;

Output

quarter	sales
1	      553037.52
2	      1120846.51

Discussion:

This problem did not feel like a medium difficulty problem. it involved Joining a table on two seperate columns to guarentee keeping unique rows,
a case statement to create a quarter column, fitering for dates earlier than july, all of that wrapped into a CTE. My biggest difficulty here was
figuring out a way to join the tables together when there wasn't an obvious column like "ID" to join on.
