spotify_worldwide_daily_song_ranking

id:         int
position:   int
trackname:  varchar
artist:     varchar
streams:    int
url:        varchar
date:       datetime
region:     varchar

Solution:

-- Make CTE where only position 1 occurs
-- count number of times it appears
-- order by number of times decending

with first_place as (select trackname, position 
from spotify_worldwide_daily_song_ranking
where position = 1)

select trackname, count(trackname) as times
from first_place
group by trackname
order by times desc;

Output:

trackname	                          times
HUMBLE.	                            7
Bad and Boujee (feat. Lil Uzi Vert)	1
Look What You Made Me Do	          1

Discussion:

First we filter all songs in the table where their position is 1, limiting the rows we need to query on for the remainder of the problem.
Then we simply count the number of times each song appears in out new table. Stratascratch seems to have a wide range of problems
they describe as "Medium" difficulty.
