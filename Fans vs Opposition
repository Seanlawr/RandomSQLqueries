Fans vs Opposition

Interview Question Date: March 2020
Meta/Facebook Hard
Interview Questions ID 10062

Description:

Meta/Facebook is quite keen on pushing their new programming language Hack to all their offices. 
They ran a survey to quantify the popularity of the language and send it to their employees. 
To promote Hack they have decided to pair developers which love Hack with the ones who hate it so the fans can convert the opposition. 
Their pair criteria is to match the biggest fan with biggest opposition, second biggest fan with second biggest opposition, and so on. 
Write a query which returns this pairing. Output employee ids of paired employees. Sort users with the same popularity value by id in ascending order.

Duplicates in pairings can be left in the solution. For example, (2, 3) and (3, 2) should both be in the solution.

facebook_hack_survey

employee_id:  int
age:          int
gender:       varchar
popularity:   int

Solution:

-- Create two temp tables, one with rank going up, one going down.
-- Join both temp tables on popularity
-- return the two employee ids

with unpop as (select employee_id, popularity, row_number() over (order by popularity asc) as rnk
from facebook_hack_survey),

pop as (select employee_id, popularity, (18 - rnk )  as new_rnk
from unpop
group by 1,2)

select u.employee_id as emp_1, p.employee_id as emp2
from unpop u
join pop p on u.rnk = p.new_rnk;

Output:

emp_1	emp2
2	    17
13	  8
10	  5
12	  9
1	    6
11	  3
7	    55
66	  4
0   	0
4	    66
55	  7
3	    11
6	    1
9	    12
5	    10
8	    13
17	  2

Discussion:

The idea for this query was sound: rank the table twice, one from least to most popular, and one the other way around. Then just join the two tables 
on the rank and we should get the pairs we want. I ran into a problem that I couldn't elegantly solve. I kept getting a BIGDIGIT error when trying to 
reverse the rank. I ended up having to hardcode in the number of employees at 17 + 1 to mae it work. Everything else is independant of the provided
data size, except that. count(*) + 1 - rnk kept throwing errors. Should return later to fix.
