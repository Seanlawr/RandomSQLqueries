Meta/Facebook Medium  Interview Questions ID 9782

Calculate the total revenue from each customer in March 2019. Include only customers who were active in March 2019.
Output the revenue along with the customer id and sort the results based on the revenue in descending order.

orders

id:                 int
cust_id:            int
order_date:         datetime
order_details:      varchar
total_order_cost:   int

Solution:

-- WHERE dates >= '20190301'
-- AND dates < '20190401'
-- sum up total order cost
-- group by cust_id

with CTE as (select * 
from orders
WHERE order_date >= '2019-03-01'
AND order_date < '2019-04-01')

select cust_id, sum(total_order_cost) as revenue
from CTE
group by cust_id
order by revenue desc;

Output: 
Output

cust_id	revenue
3	      210
15	    150
7	      80
12	    20

Discussion: 

This query required making a CTE to filter only entries between the two required dates. I used AND to specify the two dates, but probably could have made use of a
BETWEEN statement to simplify the code.
